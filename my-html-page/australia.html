			<p class="about-me"> After my travels in Europe, I was desperate for more adventures.
				I decided to apply for a Working Holiday Visa, which allows indiviuals under the age of 30 to live and work in Australia for a minimum of a year. 
				I arrived in June 2019 and originally had the opportunity to stay with a family friend near Byron Bay. I then moved to Sydney and lived 10 minutes away from Bondi Beach, one of Australia's most famous beaches.
				I worked as a street fundraiser, and raised $50,000 for a local conservation chairty. After living in Syndey for 3.5 months I moved to Melbourne. 
				I worked the same job, however this time raising $85,000 for a children's charity. These fundraising experiences were some of the most challenging, yet rewarding experiences of time in Australia and I was able to meet so many interesting people. 
				In March 2020, I decided it was time to take a break from working and genuinely travel across Australia. I had a plan to visit friends in Sydney and Byron Bay, and then visit the Great Barrier Reef in Caines, and then end with a road trip across Tasmania. 
				Unftorunately the day I started this adventure, the Prime Minister of Australia announced Australia was going into lockdown due to the pandemic, and I had 5 days to leave the country. 
				I wish that my time in Australia had not come to such an abrubt and scary end, but I absolutely have plans to go back and experience more of the magnificant country.
