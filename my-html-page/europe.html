		<p class="about-me"> My grandpa was a very adventurous man and had so many different life experiences.
			When I was 20, he asked me if I wanted to go to Europe for several months with him. I was struggling in college at the time and jumped at the offer. 
			We originally lived in Madrid, Spain for a month where we rented a cute apartment and explored the city. 
			After that my mom joined us for our travels and we explored the country for another month.
			My family offered that I could continue in Europe for another several months by myself and while it was a bit scary to solo travel in a different continent, I am so glad I took the opportunity.
			I traveled to Southern France, Norway, The Netherlands, Germany, the Czech Republic. After 3 months of traveling I volunteered at a hostel in Romania for several weeks.
			I was planning on continuing my travels, but unfortunately my grandpa was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. 
			I immediately flew home to spend his last few months together but I was so grateful for the adventures we had when he was still well. He was always such an inspiration and helped facilitate my passion for adventure.	</p>
